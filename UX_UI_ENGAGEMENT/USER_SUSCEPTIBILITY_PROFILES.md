## Detection Applications

These profiles inform detection by:
1. **Identifying high-intensity combinations** (pattern × profile)
2. **Measuring influence intensity** when products target susceptible profiles
3. **Assessing audience responsiveness patterns** based on demographic indicators
4. **Prioritizing analysis** for highest-intensity scenarios
