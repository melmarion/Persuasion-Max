## Pattern Interaction Coefficient Hypotheses

### Two-Pattern Combinations

| Combination | Hypothesis | Mechanism | Confidence |
|-------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| **P1 + P6** (Variable + Urgency) | 2.1x | Reward + Scarcity synergistic urgency | Medium |
| **P4 + P5** (Loss + Sunk Cost) | 2.4x | Loss aversion × sunk cost amplifies | High |
| **P6 + P10** (Scarcity + Social) | 1.7x | Redundant urgency signals, some overlap | Medium |
| **P8 + P11** (Immersive + Social) | 2.6x | Flow state deepens with social presence | High |
| **P3 + P4** (Celebration + Loss) | 1.4x | Antagonistic valence creates confusion | Low |
| **P2 + P7** (Momentum + Emotion) | 2.3x | Near-miss emotional state is leverageable | High |
| **P11 + P12** (Community + Identity) | 2.8x | Social + Identity deep integration | High |
| **P1 + P9** (Variable + Tiering) | 2.5x | Variable rewards scaled to whale LTV | High |

### Three-Pattern Combinations

| Combination | Hypothesis | vs Linear Sum | Interaction Type |
|-------------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **P1 + P6 + P9** | 3.8x | 3.0x | Superadditive (gacha) |
| **P4 + P5 + P12** | 4.2x | 3.0x | Superadditive (retention) |
| **P2 + P3 + P7** | 2.4x | 3.0x | Subadditive (overlap) |
| **P8 + P11 + P12** | 4.5x | 3.0x | Superadditive (social) |
| **P6 + P10 + P7** | 2.6x | 3.0x | Subadditive (urgency) |

### Four-Pattern Ceiling Effect

```
Hypothesis: Diminishing returns plateau at 4+ patterns
├── Predicted ceiling: 5.0-5.5x regardless of pattern count
├── Mechanism: Cognitive load, attention saturation
└── Exception: If patterns target completely separate systems
```

### Falsification Criteria

```
TESTABLE PREDICTIONS:
├── If P4+P5 < 1.8x: Sunk cost/loss aversion interaction overestimated
├── If P6+P10 > 2.2x: Scarcity/social proof not redundant
├── If P3+P4 > 1.8x: Valence conflict hypothesis wrong
├── If 4-pattern stack > 6.0x: Ceiling effect hypothesis wrong
└── If any combo < 1.0x: Antagonistic interaction discovered
```

---

## Interaction Type Definitions

### Superadditive
Combined effect > sum of individual effects
- **Example:** P1 + P6 + P9 = 3.8x (vs 3.0x sum)
- **Mechanism:** Patterns amplify each other through different psychological systems
- **Common in:** Gacha, retention stacks

### Subadditive
Combined effect < sum of individual effects
- **Example:** P2 + P3 + P7 = 2.4x (vs 3.0x sum)
- **Mechanism:** Patterns compete for same psychological resources
- **Common in:** Urgency stacks, feedback stacks

### Antagonistic
Combined effect < either individual effect
- **Example:** P3 + P4 = 1.4x (vs 1.0x individual)
- **Mechanism:** Conflicting valence creates cognitive dissonance
- **Avoid:** Celebration immediately followed by loss framing
