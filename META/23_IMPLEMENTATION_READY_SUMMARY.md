## COMPLETE SPECIFICATION BREAKDOWN

### PART 1: STIMULUS DETECTION (6 Patterns)

#### PERSONAL Stimulus
```
├─ Exclusion Language: regex pattern + point scoring (20 pts each)
├─ Status Threat: exact string matching + 30 pts each
├─ Tribal Safety: substring matching + 25 pts each
└─ Composite: weighted average formula
```

#### CONTRASTABLE Stimulus
```
├─ Binary Pairs: connector detection + opposite concept matching
├─ Spectrum Rejection: phrase detection with negation
└─ Composite: weighted average formula
```

#### TANGIBLE Stimulus
```
├─ Material Specificity: regex for measurements (gsm, g/m², lb/yd², etc.)
├─ Production Origin: location pattern + narrative detection
├─ Product Decay: decay verb detection + timeframe extraction
└─ Composite: weighted average formula
```

#### MEMORABLE Stimulus
```
├─ First Encounter: position check (0-50 words) + visceral language
├─ Last Encounter: position check (last 50 words) + hook detection
├─ Middle Sparseness: content density calculation
└─ Composite: weighted average formula
```

#### VISUAL Stimulus
```
├─ Anti-Aesthetic: image analysis (grain, blur, exposure)
├─ Surveillance Aesthetic: CCTV properties detection
├─ Documentary Coldness: styling absence + isolation detection
└─ Composite: weighted average formula
```

#### EMOTIONAL Stimulus
```
├─ Fear Activation: fear trigger words (15 pts each)
├─ Relief Trigger: relief words + temporal proximity check
├─ Ambivalence/Melancholy: ambivalent phrase + tone analysis
└─ Composite: weighted average formula with arc bonus
```

### PART 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES (20+ Patterns)

#### AUTHORITY
```
├─ Credentials: 15 pts per credential (Dr., Ph.D, Expert, etc.)
├─ Institutions: 20 pts per top-tier, 12 pts per medium, 5 pts per low
├─ Threat Reduction: -20 pts per objection addressed
└─ Formula: (credentials + institutions) / threat_reduction
```

#### SOCIAL PROOF
```
├─ Numeric Consensus: 20 pts per consensus claim (percentage or count)
├─ Celebrity Endorsement: 25 pts for A-list, 15 pts for B-list, 8 pts for C-list
├─ Peer Behavior: 18 pts per real-time behavior claim
└─ Weighted average formula
```

#### RECIPROCITY
```
├─ Give First Signals: 20 pts per free offering (max 40)
├─ Obligation Language: 15 pts per obligation phrase (max 45)
├─ Timing: strength multiplier based on proximity (<100 words = 0.90x)
└─ Weighted formula with timing modifier
```

#### COMMITMENT
```
├─ Small Commitment: 20 pts per action request (max 60)
├─ Escalation Path: 25 pts per escalation level (max 75)
├─ Identity Lock: 25 pts per public/artifact creation (max 100)
└─ Weighted average formula
```

#### SCARCITY
```
├─ Limitation: 15 pts per claim (max 60)
├─ Competition: 20 pts per signal (max 80)
├─ Destruction: 30 pts per permanent removal claim (max 90)
├─ Urgency: 15 pts per time-pressure (max 60)
└─ Multi-scarcity bonus: 1.15x if multiple types
```

### PART 3: ADVANCED FRAMEWORKS (7 Patterns)

#### COGNITIVE LOAD MANAGEMENT
```
├─ Complexity: sentence length, technical terms, concept density, visuals
├─ Time Pressure: deadline extraction + decision complexity multiplier
├─ Distraction: auto-play videos, popups, animations counted
└─ Weighted formula: 0.40 complexity + 0.35 time + 0.25 distraction
```

#### DECISION FATIGUE EXPLOITATION
```
├─ Decision Multiplication: count choice points × 15 pts
├─ Sequential Asks: ask escalation pattern detection
├─ Fatigue Positioning: major ask positioned after 5+ prior decisions
└─ Weighted formula with positioning multiplier
```

### PART 4: COMPOSITE SCORING

```
Formula: (stimulus_avg × 0.35) + (psych_avg × 0.35) + (advanced_avg × 0.30)

Where:
├─ stimulus_avg = average of 6 stimulus scores
├─ psych_avg = average of all principle scores used
├─ advanced_avg = average of all framework scores used
└─ Interaction bonus: 1.10-1.20x if multiple frameworks overlap

Result: 0-100 scale
├─ 0-25: LOW (ethical persuasion)
├─ 26-50: MODERATE (industry standard)
├─ 51-75: HIGH (requires scrutiny)
└─ 76-100: EXTREME (leverageative)
```

### PART 5: DECISION TREES (3 Trees)

#### Tree 1: Immediate Red Flag Detection
```
Boolean logic with 4 branches:
├─ (personal > 60 AND emotional > 70) → HIGH severity
├─ (scarcity > 70 AND destruction_present) → EXTREME severity
├─ (authority > 50 AND threat = 0) → HIGH severity
└─ (decision_fatigue > 50 AND major_ask) → HIGH severity

Result: red_flag_detected = TRUE/FALSE + severity level
```

#### Tree 2: Audience Vulnerability Assessment
```
Categorical assignment of 6 vulnerability dimensions:
├─ Identity-conscious (personal > 50 OR emotional > 55)
├─ Ideologically-driven (contrastable > 50)
├─ Emotionally-responsive (emotional_arc_complete AND emotional > 60)
├─ Status-conscious/FOMO (scarcity > 60 AND competition > 2)
├─ Authority-deference (authority > 50 AND objections < 2)
└─ Cognitive-overload (cognitive_load > 60 OR decision_fatigue > 60)

Result: vulnerability_dimensions list + severity level
```

#### Tree 3: Influence strategy Intensity Classification
```
Threshold-based action assignment:
├─ 0-25: ETHICAL → action = NONE
├─ 26-50: MODERATE → action = MONITOR
├─ 51-75: HIGH → action = REVIEW_REQUIRED
└─ 76-100: EXTREME → action = IMMEDIATE_REMEDIATION

Result: classification + recommended action
```

### PART 6: OUTPUT FORMAT

Complete JSON schema with:
```
├─ audit_metadata (id, timestamp, hash, confidence)
├─ stimulus_scores (all 6 with breakdown)
├─ psychological_principles (all 20+ with breakdown)
├─ advanced_frameworks (all 7 with breakdown)
├─ composite_scores (overall index + risk level)
├─ vulnerability_profile (dimensions + severity)
├─ red_flags (list of detected issues)
├─ decision_tree_results (all 3 trees)
├─ machine_flagging_summary (counts + confidence)
└─ remediation_recommendations (specific fixes)
```
