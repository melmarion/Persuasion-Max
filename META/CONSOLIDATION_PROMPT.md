# TASK: Consolidate LINGUISTIC_PERSUASION Files (26 → ~6 Numbered Prompts)

## CONTEXT

I have a project at `C:\Users\Mario\Downloads\UX & Persuasion\` with two main content areas:

1. **UX folder** — ALREADY DONE. 60+ source files were consolidated into 7 numbered prompts (`1_DESIGN_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` through `7_IMPLEMENTATION_LIFECYCLE_PROMPT.md`) + a README + a .py file. Source files were deleted after extraction. This is the gold standard — replicate this approach.

2. **Persuasion Max/LINGUISTIC_PERSUASION/** — THIS IS YOUR TASK. 26 files across two subfolders (DETECTION/ and RESEARCH/) need to be consolidated into a small number of numbered prompt files, the same way the UX folder was done.

## YOUR GOAL

Consolidate the 26 LINGUISTIC_PERSUASION files into **as few numbered prompt files as possible** (target: ~6) without losing ANY unique content. Each consolidated prompt should be a self-contained document that can be sent to an AI to implement linguistic persuasion techniques.

The consolidated files should live at:
```
C:\Users\Mario\Downloads\UX & Persuasion\Persuasion Max\LINGUISTIC_PERSUASION\
```

Delete the DETECTION/ and RESEARCH/ subfolders and their files ONLY after all content has been extracted into the new numbered prompts. Create a README documenting the consolidation (mapping old files → new prompts).

## SOURCE FILES TO CONSOLIDATE

## SUGGESTED CONSOLIDATION STRUCTURE

This is a starting suggestion — adjust based on what you find when reading the files. The goal is logical grouping with zero content loss:

1. **`1_TACTICAL_PSYCHOLOGICAL_FRAMEWORKS_PROMPT.md`** — Merge files 11 + 12 + 13 + 14. The three core detection/implementation frameworks (tactical stimuli, psychological principles, advanced techniques) plus the index content as an introduction.

2. **`2_LINGUISTIC_RHETORIC_PROMPT.md`** — Merge LINGUISTIC_PERSUASION_RESEARCH + CLASSICAL_RHETORICAL_TECHNIQUES + LINGUISTIC_DETECTION_FRAMEWORK. All language-based persuasion: rhetorical devices, syntactic patterns, semantic framing, pragmatics, 265 classical techniques, production detection code.

3. **`3_TECHNIQUE_RANKINGS_AND_COMBINATIONS_PROMPT.md`** — Merge 28_EXPANDED_RANKED_COMBINATIONS + 25_EXPANDED_RESEARCH_DIMENSIONS + EMPIRICAL_RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS. All effectiveness data: 50+ ranked combinations, multipliers, research dimensions, empirical findings.

4. **`4_FRACTIONATION_AND_ADVANCED_MECHANICS_PROMPT.md`** — Merge FRACTIONATION_BEHAVIORAL_SCIENCE + FRACTIONATION_DETECTION_METHODS + BEHAVIORAL_ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK + INTEGRITY_VIOLATION_DETECTION_FRAMEWORK. Fractionation (emotional cycling), behavioral analysis, integrity violations.

5. **`5_DETECTION_SYSTEMS_AND_AUDITING_PROMPT.md`** — Merge 15 + 17 + 24 + 26 + 27. All detection/auditing infrastructure: professional auditor manual, machine-readable system, ML/AI approaches, comprehensive frameworks, high-impact detection code.

6. **`6_EVOLUTION_AND_CASE_STUDIES_PROMPT.md`** — Merge EVOLUTION_ANALYSIS + EVOLUTION_PATTERNS_AND_MECHANISMS + 19_REAL_WORLD_CASE_STUDIES + APPENDIX_RESEARCH_SOURCES + RESEARCH_SUMMARY_AND_NEXT_STEPS. Historical progression, case studies, citations, research roadmap.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Do NOT lose any unique content.** Every technical spec, Python code block, data point, case study, formula, threshold, and scoring criterion must appear in the consolidated output. When in doubt, include it — it is always better to be safe and make a longer version than to miss details.

2. **There are no contradictions, only nuance.** If two files say slightly different things about the same topic, include BOTH with context. Do not resolve apparent conflicts by deleting one version.

3. **Preserve all technical specifics.** All numbers, thresholds, multipliers, frequencies, effect sizes, Cohen's d values, percentages, timing specs, regex patterns, Python code — keep exact values unchanged.

4. **Read every file COMPLETELY before consolidating.** Do not skim. Do not summarize. Read every line of every file to identify all unique content.

5. **Delete source files ONLY after extraction is verified.** After creating each consolidated prompt, verify that all content from the source files is present. Only then delete the source files.

6. **Create a README** (`README_LINGUISTIC_PERSUASION.md`) documenting:
   - What each consolidated prompt contains
   - Mapping of old files → new prompts (like the UX README does)
   - Line counts and content summaries
   - How to use each prompt (which to send for what goal)
   - A "NOTHING LOST" verification section

7. **The index/overview files** (14_DETECTION_FRAMEWORKS_MASTER_INDEX, RESEARCH_INDEX, BEHAVIORAL_SCIENTIST_RESEARCH_PACKAGE, RESEARCH_SUMMARY_AND_NEXT_STEPS) are pure meta-documentation. Their unique content (summaries, research questions, next steps) should be absorbed into the README or into the opening sections of relevant prompts. They should NOT become standalone prompts.

8. **There is an existing `README_LINGUISTIC_PERSUASION.md`** in the LINGUISTIC_PERSUASION folder. Replace it with the new comprehensive README after consolidation.

## WORKFLOW

1. Read ALL 26 files completely. Take inventory of unique content in each.
2. Identify overlaps and determine the optimal grouping.
3. Create consolidated prompt files one at a time.
4. After creating each prompt, verify content coverage against source files.
5. After ALL prompts are created and verified, delete source files and DETECTION/RESEARCH subfolders.
6. Create/update the README with full documentation.
7. Final verification: confirm the consolidated prompts contain every piece of unique content from the 26 source files.

## REFERENCE: HOW THE UX CONSOLIDATION WAS DONE

Look at `C:\Users\Mario\Downloads\UX & Persuasion\UX\README_7_PROMPTS.md` for the exact format and documentation style used in the UX consolidation. Replicate that level of detail in your README. Key features to replicate:
- Per-prompt content listings with checkmarks
- Source → destination mapping table
- Consolidation statistics
- "How to Use" section with goal-based recommendations
- "Nothing Lost" verification section
- Quality assurance checklist
