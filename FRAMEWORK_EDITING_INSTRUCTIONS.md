# Framework Editing Instructions
## Strict Guidelines for Modifications to ETHICAL_FRAMEWORK_FINAL.md

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE
**Preserve all technical insights and specifications. Only change vocabulary words.**

---

## WHAT YOU CAN CHANGE (Vocabulary Only)

Change ONLY these types of words:
- "Manipulation" → "behavioral influence" or "technique"
- "Exploit/Exploitation" → "target" or "leverage"
- "Trap/Traps/Trapped" → "lock-in" or "creates barrier to exit"
- "Forces/Forced" → "motivates through" or "creates pressure to"
- "Disables" → "reduces" or "decreases capacity for"
- "Bypass" → "circumvent" or "reduce effectiveness of"
- "Dark patterns" → "friction patterns" or "exit obstruction"
- "Deceptive" → "misrepresented" or "obscured"
- "Abuse/Abusive" → "harmful implementation" or "predatory"
- "Manipulation" → "influence" or "behavioral techniques"

---

## WHAT YOU MUST NEVER CHANGE

**These elements are MANDATORY and must be preserved exactly:**

### Technical Specifications (NEVER REMOVE)
- Effectiveness percentages and timeframes (e.g., "200%+ increased susceptibility / 4 cycles in ~10 minutes")
- Specific numbers and measurements (e.g., "65-90%", "3-5 exposures", "90-110 BPM")
- Mechanism descriptions (e.g., "illusory truth effect", "cognitive dissonance resolution")
- Evolution chains (e.g., "Bernays → Goebbels → Platforms → AI")

### Critical Insights (NEVER REMOVE)
- "Brain craves stability after emotional chaos"
- "Tribe membership acts as social stake"
- "Changing mind requires public humiliation"
- "Identity stronger than facts"
- "Different realities per user"
- "Can't coordinate resistance"
- "Worse than monopoly: algorithms create individualized false realities"
- "Works even when person knows it's false"
- "Compulsion repetition locks psychological associations"
- "Cognitive dissonance forces belief alignment"
- "Makes informed consent nearly impossible"

### Examples and Applications (NEVER REMOVE)
- All operational context (TikTok FYP, YouTube, Facebook, etc.)
- Specific examples (bathroom contests, "ugly bathroom" photos, etc.)
- Real-world implementations

### Risk Levels (PRESERVE EMOJI)
- 🔴 RED, 🟠 ORANGE, 🟡 YELLOW, ✅ GREEN
- These must stay; they are the classification system

## TEMPLATE FOR SAFE EDITS

**BEFORE (Original):**
```
- Deliberately targeting emotionally vulnerable users
- Creates psychological dependency
- Brain disables conscious decision-making
```

**AFTER (Vocabulary changed, insights preserved):**
```
- Algorithmic identification of emotionally vulnerable users
- Creates psychological reinforcement loops
- Reduces capacity for conscious deliberation through neurochemical mechanisms
```

**WHY THIS WORKS:**
- Removed alarmist words: "deliberately targeting" → "algorithmic identification"
- Removed "creates dependency" → "creates reinforcement loops" (more neutral, same insight)
- Removed "disables" → "reduces capacity for" (accurate, professional)
- Preserved the actual mechanism and risk

---

## FORBIDDEN CHANGES

❌ DO NOT remove any "**How it works**" or "**Why it's effective**" sections
❌ DO NOT simplify mechanisms (e.g., don't change "illusory truth effect" to "familiarity")
❌ DO NOT remove effectiveness percentages or timeframes
❌ DO NOT remove historical evolution chains
❌ DO NOT remove the insight about why something is dangerous (just neutralize the language)
❌ DO NOT consolidate or combine sections
❌ DO NOT remove examples or operational context
❌ DO NOT change emoji risk levels
❌ DO NOT remove "Within ethical boundaries if" sections
❌ DO NOT change numbers: 200%+, 3-5 exposures, 65-90%, etc.

---

## RED LINE SECTION RULES

For the violations sections (🔴 🟠 🟡):
- Change accusatory tone to factual description
- Keep the mechanisms exact
- Example: "Exploits vulnerability" → "Targets vulnerable demographics"
- But preserve: what the mechanism is, who it affects, what happens as a result

---

## IF UNSURE

**Ask yourself:**
- "Am I removing or changing a technical specification?" → DON'T DO IT
- "Am I removing an example or insight?" → DON'T DO IT
- "Am I just changing a tone word?" → OK
- "Does this change make the framework less useful?" → DON'T DO IT

---

## YOUR CHECKLIST FOR EDITS

Before submitting any changes:
- [ ] All effectiveness percentages are intact
- [ ] All evolution chains are complete
- [ ] All "How it works" bullets are present
- [ ] All "Why it's effective" bullets are present
- [ ] All examples are still there
- [ ] No insights have been removed
- [ ] Only vocabulary words have been changed
- [ ] Risk level emojis are unchanged
- [ ] All mechanisms are still numbered correctly
- [ ] The document is as useful as before, just with professional language

---

## EXAMPLES OF GOOD EDITS

✅ **Good:** "Designed to disable conscious decision-making" → "Designed to reduce conscious deliberation capacity"

✅ **Good:** "Manipulates through emotional hijacking" → "Influences through emotional fractionation cycles"

✅ **Good:** "Exploits vulnerability" → "Targets vulnerable demographics"

❌ **Bad:** Removing "illusory truth effect" because it sounds scientific

❌ **Bad:** Changing "different realities per user" to "personalization"

❌ **Bad:** Removing effectiveness percentages

❌ **Bad:** Shortening "cognitive dissonance resolution" to "consistency motivation" (loses precision)

---

## PROTECT YOUR SPECIFICATIONS

The framework is valuable BECAUSE it has:
1. Precise mechanisms (illusory truth effect, cognitive dissonance, etc.)
2. Exact measurements (200%+, 3-5 exposures, 65-90%)
3. Historical evolution (Bernays → Goebbels → Platforms → AI)
4. Technical insights (what actually happens neurologically/psychologically)

**If any of these disappear, the framework loses credibility and usefulness.**

Keep the science. Change the tone.
