# Behavioral Influence Framework: Technical Classification System
## Systematic Organization of Persuasion Techniques by Operational Characteristics

---

## CLASSIFICATION DIMENSIONS: Organizational Framework

Influence techniques can be classified across three operational dimensions:

### 🔴 DIMENSION 1: Information Accuracy Specification
Characterizes whether techniques require factually accurate claims about product function or data practices.

**Techniques with factual accuracy constraints:**
- Credential specification and validation
- Commercial relationship transparency
- User identity accuracy
- Testimonial and review authenticity
- Data practice specification
- Technical specification accuracy

**Techniques without factual accuracy constraints:**
- Presentation framing and design
- Social proof aggregation
- Scarcity signaling
- Emotional narrative selection
- Reference point anchoring
- Authority role specification

---

### 🟠 DIMENSION 2: User Exit Mechanics
Characterizes whether techniques include simplified exit pathways or enhanced exit friction.

**Exit friction characteristics:**
- Cancellation pathway complexity
- Upsell sequencing before exit
- Reason collection at exit
- Deletion delay implementation
- Opt-out step requirements
- Subscription information visibility

**Exit simplification characteristics:**
- Security-appropriate verification
- Single-step cancellation availability
- Optional feedback mechanisms
- Automatic data retention policies
- Equivalent opt-out/opt-in pathways
- Clear unsubscribe information

---

### 🟡 DIMENSION 3: Population Targeting Specificity
Characterizes whether techniques employ undifferentiated or vulnerability-targeted approaches.

**Vulnerability targeting approaches:**
- Substance addiction targeting
- Financial vulnerability targeting
- Psychological fragility targeting
- Developmental vulnerability targeting (minors)
- Urgency-based conversion targeting

**Undifferentiated targeting approaches:**
- Population-level implementation
- Standard service delivery
- Need-based service targeting
- Age-appropriate product provision
- Voluntary engagement mechanisms

---

## BEHAVIORAL MECHANISMS RANKED BY MEASURED EFFECTIVENESS

Techniques are ordered by documented effectiveness metrics.

---

### 1️⃣ EMOTIONAL FRACTIONATION CYCLES
**Measured effectiveness:** 200%+ increased behavioral susceptibility
**Implementation timeframe:** 4 cycles in ~10 minutes
**Documented evolution:** Platform optimization (2010-2020) → AI-calibrated personalization (2020-2026)
**Classification:** Dimension 3 (population targeting specificity) - individual-level emotional state targeting

**Operational mechanism:**
- Algorithmic sequencing: anger → joy → anger → relief/solution
- Neurochemical response: craving for stability after emotional disruption
- Automation characteristics: operates without explicit user awareness
- Calibration method: real-time behavioral data enables individual-level optimization

**Effectiveness factors:**
- Neurochemical state bypasses explicit rational evaluation pathways
- Operates below conscious threshold (90-110 BPM heart rate entrainment)
- Personalized to individual emotional response patterns
- Cumulative effects compound with repeated exposures

**Documented platform implementations:**
- TikTok FYP: discovered empirically through engagement optimization
- YouTube recommendation algorithm: implemented through sequential recommendations
- Instagram/Facebook feeds: continuous optimization for this pattern
- Platforms generally: optimization focus on engagement metrics rather than explicit mechanism understanding

**Technical measurement:**
- Behavioral output: measured through engagement metrics and behavioral persistence
- Physiological markers: heart rate variability, skin conductance, blink rate patterns
- Neurochemical correlates: cortisol, oxytocin, dopamine response profiles

---

### 2️⃣ IDENTITY LOCK-IN THROUGH PUBLIC COMMITMENT
**Effectiveness:** 65-90%+ behavior consistency after public act
**Evolution:** Bernays (product branding) → Goebbels (forced denunciation) → Platforms (algorithmic amplification)
**Risk Level:** 🟡 (approaches Rule 3 boundary; uses behavioral coercion not deception)

**How it works:**
- User takes public position (social media post, tweet, public donation)
- Algorithm amplifies to tribe/followers
- Tribe validates position
- Changing mind now = public humiliation + loss of tribal status
- Brain forces belief alignment to justify public behavior (cognitive dissonance resolution)

**Why it's effective:**
- Identity stronger than facts
- Public commitment → behavioral lock-in
- Social consequences (not just private belief change)
- Tribe membership acts as hostage

**Operational context:**
- Twitter/X algorithmic amplification of takes
- Facebook group identity formation
- Reddit upvote systems rewarding tribal positions
- "Call-out culture" reinforcing identity lock
- Cancel culture punishing inconsistency

**Ethics boundary:** Uses social pressure + algorithmic amplification, not deception or obstruction

---

### 3️⃣ ALGORITHMIC ISOLATION & CUSTOM REALITY CONSTRUCTION
**Effectiveness:** 70-85% persistence of bubble-reinforced beliefs
**Evolution:** Goebbels (monopoly control) → Platforms (personalized bubbles) → AI (custom reality tunnels)
**Risk Level:** 🟠/🔴 (approaches Rule 1 boundary if isolation becomes complete falsehood)

**How it works:**
- Different users see different realities through algorithmic curation
- Counter-narratives actively suppressed from feed
- User perceives feed as objective reality (doesn't know they're in bubble)
- Can't coordinate resistance (can't see what others see)

**Why it's effective:**
- Makes informed consent nearly impossible (can't know what you're missing)
- User doesn't recognize bubble (thinks they see reality)
- Removes external reality check
- Self-reinforcing (algorithm learns what keeps user engaged)

**Operational context:**
- Facebook/Instagram personalized feeds
- YouTube recommendation systems
- TikTok FYP algorithmic bubble
- News feed algorithms
- Search result personalization

**Ethics boundary:** Doesn't technically violate rules but creates environment where informed consent becomes impossible (precondition for manipulation)

---

### 4️⃣ DEFAULT CHOICE ARCHITECTURE
**Effectiveness:** 50-90% depending on friction (organ donation: 40% opt-in vs. 90% opt-out)
**Evolution:** Kahneman (identified) → Platforms (automated into design)
**Risk Level:** 🟡 (legal, efficient, but exploits cognitive bias)

**How it works:**
- Path of least resistance = platform-desired outcome
- Most users accept default rather than actively decide
- Changing default requires decision energy; most don't expend it

**Why it's effective:**
- People don't choose; they accept defaults
- No friction required (works through inaction)
- Cumulative (millions of users × 70% conversion rate)

**Operational context:**
- Newsletter subscribed by default (4-5x higher signup than opt-in)
- Netflix "Continue Watching" defaults
- Spotify "Add to Queue" pre-selected
- Device settings favoring data collection
- Cookie preferences with "accept all" as default

**Ethics boundary:** Completely transparent, legal, and reversible—but exploits decision-making bias

---

### 5️⃣ AUTHORITY SYMBOL (Credibility Transfer)
**Effectiveness:** 65%+ obedience increase with authority symbol (Milgram: 65% administered shocks WITH authority, 20% without)
**Evolution:** Bernays (invented fake experts) → Goebbels (destroyed real authorities) → Platforms (influencer authority) → AI (deepfakes)
**Risk Level:** 🔴/🟡 (deepfakes cross into Rule 1; influencer authority doesn't)

**How it works:**
- Lab coat = authority even if wearer isn't doctor (symbol matters more than competence)
- Credibility transfers: "Expert says X" → "X is true"
- Works even when audience knows it's persuasion technique
- Symbol can be credential stacking, title inflation, or synthetic generation

**Why it's effective:**
- Authority is social organizing principle (ancient hardwiring)
- Bypasses individual evaluation (delegate to "expert")
- Works even when known (people ignore knowledge of vulnerability)

**Operational context:**
- Influencer endorsements (authority = social proof, not expertise)
- Certification programs without actual competence verification
- Blue checkmark signals (status, not competence)
- AI-generated expert videos (perfect fidelity, no actual authority)
- Academic-sounding studies (funded by interested parties)

**Ethics boundary:** Transparent authority (disclosed credentials) = OK. Fake credentials / deepfakes = Rule 1 violation

---

### 6️⃣ SOCIAL PROOF (Manufactured Consensus)
**Effectiveness:** 35-75% depending on visibility and recency
**Evolution:** Bernays (multiple sources same message) → Cialdini (measured: "75% of guests reuse towels" = 35% more compliance) → Platforms (algorithmic amplification)
**Risk Level:** 🟡 (real consensus perceived as larger; unrepresentative samples mislead)

**How it works:**
- Perceived consensus drives behavior more than actual consensus
- Shows 5-star reviews, hides 1-star reviews (representative bias)
- "Most people are doing X" notifications create bandwagon effect
- Bot armies can create illusion of popularity

**Why it's effective:**
- People don't think independently; follow crowd
- Especially effective when uncertain
- Asymmetric sample (showing best cases) feels representative

**Operational context:**
- Fake reviews / review bombing
- Astroturfing (fake grassroots campaigns)
- Bot armies creating illusion of support
- Algorithmic amplification making minority views seem universal
- "Everyone else is doing this" notifications
- Visible testimonial counts (without showing distribution)

**Ethics boundary:** Real testimonials showing distribution = OK. Fake reviews / deceptive selection = Rule 1 violation

---

### 7️⃣ SCARCITY & LOSS AVERSION
**Effectiveness:** 60%+ higher conversion ("Only 2 left" beats "Great deal")
**Evolution:** Bernays (manufactured obsolescence) → Goebbels (existential scarcity framing) → Cialdini (measured effect) → Platforms (dynamic scarcity signals)
**Risk Level:** 🟡 (real scarcity = green; fake scarcity = red)

**How it works:**
- Loss aversion: "You might LOSE this" hits harder than "You could GAIN this"
- Real scarcity: Actually limited inventory
- Fake scarcity: "Only 3 left" refreshes infinitely
- Dynamic scarcity: "5 people viewing now" (real count but shown to many)

**Why it's effective:**
- Hardwired loss aversion (fear of missing out)
- Overrides rational deliberation
- Works even when person knows it's scarcity signal

**Operational context:**
- Booking.com "5 people viewing now"
- Sale countdown timers (real or arbitrary)
- Limited edition drops in sneaker culture
- "Seller may not have more inventory"
- Dynamic inventory warnings

**Ethics boundary:** Honest scarcity = OK. Fake scarcity ("Only 3 left" that refreshes) = Rule 1 violation

---

### 8️⃣ RECIPROCITY OBLIGATION
**Effectiveness:** 2x+ higher compliance (unexpected gift → 2x raffle ticket purchases)
**Evolution:** Bernays (free samples create obligation) → Cialdini (measured empirically) → Platforms (free tier → obligated upgrade)
**Risk Level:** ✅ (transparent exchange; obligation feels automatic but is clear)

**How it works:**
- Gift (real or perceived) creates obligation to reciprocate
- Unexpected gifts = stronger effect
- Works subconsciously (obligation feels automatic)
- Sunk cost amplifies (time invested makes obligation stronger)

**Why it's effective:**
- Deeply ingrained social rule (reciprocity is ancient norm)
- Obligation feels automatic (not like choice)
- Harder to refuse than direct request

**Operational context:**
- Free samples (creates obligation to buy)
- Free tier software → push to upgrade
- Free trial + setup time (sunk cost amplifies obligation)
- Unexpected compliments (builds rapport)
- Referral bonuses (creates reciprocal obligation)

**Ethics boundary:** Transparent exchange = OK. Hidden quid pro quo = Rule 1 violation

---

### 9️⃣ ANCHORING EFFECT
**Effectiveness:** 40-60% pull toward first number mentioned (even obviously random)
**Evolution:** Kahneman (identified) → Pricing strategy optimization
**Risk Level:** ✅ (transparent anchor; person aware comparison is happening)

**How it works:**
- First number mentioned = gravity; subsequent negotiation can't escape its pull
- Works even when anchor is obviously random or irrelevant
- Effect size: final agreement pulled 40-60% toward anchor
- Cumulative in multi-round negotiations

**Why it's effective:**
- Anchoring is subconscious (happens before conscious evaluation)
- Works even when known
- Asymmetric (first anchor matters more than second)

**Operational context:**
- Original price vs. sale price (anchor = original)
- Salary negotiations (first offer anchors final)
- Litigation settlements (first demand anchors settlement)
- Restaurant pricing ("drinks from $8-$50" anchors perception)

**Ethics boundary:** Transparent anchor = OK. Fake original price = Rule 1 violation

---

### 🔟 SEMANTIC FRAMING & NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE
**Effectiveness:** 20-40% behavior change depending on frame
**Evolution:** Bernays (use symbolism > logic) → Goebbels (narrative before facts) → Platforms (algorithmic narrative selection)
**Risk Level:** 🟡/✅ (depends on factual accuracy)

**How it works:**
- Same fact, different frames = different behaviors
- "Glass half full" vs. "glass half empty" = different choices
- Narrative chosen before facts = facts fit narrative, not vice versa
- Emotion + narrative together = more persuasive than facts alone

**Why it's effective:**
- Stories are more memorable than data
- Emotion + narrative binds identity
- People believe facts that fit their narrative

**Operational context:**
- Marketing language ("invest in yourself" vs. "pay for gym")
- Political framing ("job creators" vs. "wealthy elite")
- News headlines (frame determines interpretation)
- Product naming (same feature, different name = different valuation)

**Ethics boundary:** True facts, alternative framing = OK. Facts selected to misrepresent = Rule 1 violation

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ MICRO-TARGETING & PERSONALIZATION
**Effectiveness:** 30-50% depending on targeting accuracy
**Evolution:** Bernays (segment by archetype) → Platforms (segment by psychology) → AI (individual vulnerability mapping)
**Risk Level:** 🟡/🔴 (depends on whether targeting vulnerable populations)

**How it works:**
- Different messages for different people based on psychological profile
- Efficient personalization (right message, right person)
- Can exploit specific vulnerabilities (problem gambling, mental health)
- User doesn't know they're receiving personalized message

**Why it's effective:**
- Removes message friction (speaks directly to individual motivation)
- Efficient for platform (higher conversion)
- Can identify and exploit psychological weak points

**Operational context:**
- Facebook micro-targeted ads with audience-specific narratives
- Different landing pages for different user types
- Dynamic pricing based on willingness to pay
- Algorithmic feed showing what each person likely engages with

**Ethics boundary:** Efficient personalization = OK. Targeting vulnerable populations = Rule 3 violation

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ REPETITION & COMPULSION LOOPS
**Effectiveness:** Cumulative (familiarity misattributed to accuracy after 3-5 exposures)
**Evolution:** Freud (identified compulsion repetition) → Bernays (yearly events) → Goebbels (70-80% all broadcasts) → Platforms (infinite scroll + algorithmic repetition) → AI (predictive repetition optimization)
**Risk Level:** 🟡 (automation + continuous repetition approaches manipulation territory)

**How it works:**
- Repeated exposure = illusory truth effect (familiar = true)
- False statements feel true after 3-5 exposures
- Compulsion repetition locks psychological associations
- Habit formation through repetition (neural pathway strengthening)

**Why it's effective:**
- Operates below conscious awareness
- Works even when person knows it's false
- Cumulative (each exposure strengthens association)

**Operational context:**
- Infinite scroll = continuous custom repetition per user
- Algorithmic feed personalizes which content repeats
- Seasonal campaigns cycling annually
- Subscription models enforcing repetition
- Habit-forming app design

**Ethics boundary:** Transparent repetition (yearly marketing) = OK. Deceptive repetition (algorithm pretending to be random) = approaches Rule 1

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ VISUAL SHAME + PRODUCT SOLUTION PAIRS
**Effectiveness:** 15-30% behavior change (context dependent)
**Evolution:** Bernays (bathroom contest with shame imagery) → Modern marketing (before/after transformations)
**Risk Level:** 🟡 (emotional manipulation of real insecurity)

**How it works:**
- Create visual discomfort / insecurity (photo of "ugly bathroom")
- Offer branded solution (Kohler bathrooms fix problem)
- Shame → relief emotional arc
- Problem creation + solution sales

**Why it's effective:**
- Touches real insecurities (shame is powerful motivator)
- Offers actual solution (not false relief)
- Emotional arc creates memory binding

**Operational context:**
- Before/after transformation content
- Social media "you vs. her" comparison
- Product-as-solution to appearance anxiety
- Algorithmic amplification of insecurity content

**Ethics boundary:** Addressing real needs = OK. Amplifying insecurity to create artificial need = 🟡

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC (Vivid = Frequent)
**Effectiveness:** 20-40% bias in frequency estimation
**Evolution:** Bernays (media multiplication) → Goebbels (frequency saturation) → Platforms (algorithmic amplification)
**Risk Level:** 🟡 (algorithmic misrepresentation about frequency)

**How it works:**
- Vivid/memorable events judged as more frequent
- Media coverage distorts perceived frequency
- Homicides covered heavily = seem more common than suicides (opposite true)
- Algorithmic feed showing extreme cases = seems representative

**Why it's effective:**
- Memory = frequency heuristic (what's memorable must be common)
- Works even when person knows fallacy
- Self-reinforcing (more coverage = more memorable)

**Operational context:**
- Terrorism amplified by news = overestimated danger
- Algorithmic feed showing extreme outgroup = seems representative
- FOMO via Instagram = everyone having fun seems universal
- Media sensationalism distorting risk perception

**Ethics boundary:** Proportional coverage = OK. Disproportionate amplification = 🟡/🔴

---

### 1️⃣5️⃣ LIKING & SIMILARITY (Peer Authority)
**Effectiveness:** 20-35% depending on perceived similarity
**Evolution:** Bernays (salespeople trained to compliment) → Cialdini (identify with "good guy" assignment) → Platforms (relatable influencer personas)
**Risk Level:** ✅ (uses identification, not deception)

**How it works:**
- Perceived similarity = liking = influence
- Not flattery about past; assignment of future behavior
- "I hate when things happen to good guys like you" = you become "good guy"
- Compliments tied to identity, not just appearance

**Why it's effective:**
- Tribe membership is powerful motivator
- Identity assignment stronger than flattery
- Works through belonging, not rational persuasion

**Operational context:**
- Influencer "relatable" personas
- Community/tribe belonging (Discord, subreddits)
- Identity assignment through micro-interactions
- Peer testimonials vs. authority figures

**Ethics boundary:** Authentic community = OK. Manufactured parasocial relationships = 🟡

---

### 1️⃣6️⃣ COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY (Identity Persistence)
**Effectiveness:** 30-70% depending on commitment magnitude
**Evolution:** Bernays (small action locks identity) → Goebbels (forced public commitment) → Platforms (public social media commitment)
**Risk Level:** 🟡 (when combined with identity lock-in)

**How it works:**
- Create visual discomfort / insecurity (photo of "ugly bathroom")
- Offer branded solution (Kohler bathrooms fix problem)
- Shame → relief emotional arc
- Problem creation + solution sales

**Why it's effective:**
- Touches real insecurities (shame is powerful motivator)
- Offers actual solution (not false relief)
- Emotional arc creates memory binding

**Operational context:**
- Before/after transformation content
- Social media "you vs. her" comparison
- Product-as-solution to appearance anxiety

**Effectiveness:** 20-35% depending on perceived similarity
**Evolution:** Bernays (salespeople trained to compliment) → Cialdini (identify with "good guy" assignment) → Platforms (relatable influencer personas)
**Risk Level:** GREEN (uses identification, not deception)

**How it works:**
- Perceived similarity = liking = influence
- Not flattery about past; assignment of future behavior
- "I hate when things happen to good guys like you" = you become "good guy"
- Compliments tied to identity, not just appearance

---

### 15. AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC (Vivid = Frequent)
**Effectiveness:** 20-40% bias in frequency estimation
**Evolution:** Bernays (media multiplication) → Goebbels (frequency saturation) → Platforms (algorithmic amplification)
**Risk Level:** YELLOW (algorithmic misrepresentation about frequency)

**How it works:**
- Vivid/memorable events judged as more frequent
- Media coverage distorts perceived frequency
- Homicides covered heavily = seem more common than suicides (opposite true)
- Algorithmic feed showing extreme cases = seems representative

**Why it's effective:**

- Media sensationalism distorting risk perception

**Ethics boundary:** Proportional coverage = OK. Disproportionate amplification = YELLOW-RED

---

## TIER 5: LOW EFFECTIVENESS MECHANISMS / SUPPORTING TACTICS

### 16. SUNK COST FALLACY (Endowment Effect)
**Effectiveness:** 10-30% depending on cost magnitude
**Evolution:** Kahneman (identified) → Platforms (engineered entry costs)
**Risk Level:** GREEN (uses pre-existing human bias)

**How it works:**
- Money already spent irrationally drives future behavior
- Ownership doubles valuation immediately (endowment effect)
- Can't ignore sunk cost even though logically should
- Drives continued use to "justify" expenditure

**Why it's effective:**
- Asymmetric loss aversion (giving up feels worse than gaining)
- Works even when irrational
- Self-reinforcing (more invested = harder to leave)

**Operational context:**
- Free trial + setup time = sunk cost
- Expensive products = must use to justify purchase
- Gym memberships people don't use
- Pre-paid models (subscriptions, vacation packages)
- Habit formation through initial setup friction

**Ethics boundary:** Transparent costs = OK. Hidden switching costs = Rule 2 violation

---

### 17. MENTAL ACCOUNTING (Bucket Psychology)
**Effectiveness:** 10-25% valuation changes
**Evolution:** Kahneman (identified) → Behavioral design (engineered)
**Risk Level:** GREEN (uses cognitive bias, not deception)

**How it works:**
- Same $200 in different buckets has different value
- "Free to drink from cellar" vs. "paying $200 new" = different valuation
- Pre-paid gym = using feels "free" even though already spent
- Money in different mental contexts = different spending patterns

**Why it's effective:**
- Psychological accounting separated from actual accounting
- Works even when person knows it's irrational
- Enables behavior change through context framing

**Operational context:**
- Pre-paid subscriptions (feels free to use since already paid)
- Gift economy vs. personal spending (gifts spent more freely)
- Cryptocurrency as "play money" vs. real money
- Casino chips (psychological distance from real money)

**Ethics boundary:** Using mental accounting = OK. Hiding true costs through accounting = Rule 1 violation

---

### 18. COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY (Identity Persistence)
**Effectiveness:** 30-70% depending on commitment magnitude
**Evolution:** Bernays (small action locks identity) → Goebbels (forced public commitment) → Platforms (public social media commitment)
**Risk Level:** YELLOW (when combined with identity lock-in)

**How it works:**
- Once you take small commitment, pressure to behave consistently
- People maintain consistent self-image above most other goals
- Written > verbal (more binding)
- Public commitment > private (shame factor)

**Why it's effective:**
- Identity is stronger than facts, money, even safety
- Cognitive dissonance forces belief alignment with behavior
- Social proof of consistency prevents reversal

**Operational context:**
- Foot-in-door: small yes → bigger yes escalation
- Public commitments (harder to back out)
- Social media "take a side" posts locking identity
- Written pledges (more binding than verbal)
- Habit formation (repeated action → identity)

**Ethics boundary:** Voluntary commitment = OK. Coerced public commitment = Rule 3 violation

---

### 19. UNITY & TRIBE BELONGING
**Effectiveness:** 30-60% loyalty effect
**Evolution:** Freud (group archetypes) → Bernays (segmented identities) → Goebbels (unified enemy creates ingroup) → Cialdini (minimal group paradigm) → Platforms (algorithmic tribalization)
**Risk Level:** YELLOW (when combined with outgroup hostility)

**How it works:**
- Minimal Group Paradigm: random assignment to group = instant loyalty
- Even knowing assignment is arbitrary, people give money to "their" people
- Tribe doesn't need history/culture/values; assignment ALONE creates loyalty
- In-group bias stronger than rational preference

**Why it's effective:**
- Ancient hardwired tribal loyalty
- Works even when arbitrary
- Enables identity lock-in through belonging

**Operational context:**
- Gaming clans, streaming communities
- Political/cultural tribalism
- Sports fandom (neural reward for ingroup winning)
- Cryptocurrency communities
- Brand loyalty cults (Apple, Tesla, Patagonia)

**Ethics boundary:** Creating genuine community = OK. Algorithmic tribalization creating artificial enemies = YELLOW-RED

---

## RED LINE VIOLATIONS: Techniques That Cross Boundaries

These techniques violate one or more of the three bright lines. **Do not use.**

### ❌ RULE 1 VIOLATIONS: False Claims About Product Function

**Fake Authority/Credentials**
- Creating fake expert (Bernays' dental association)

- Harm: Prevents accurate perception of reality
- Example: Social media creating false impression of widespread support

---

### ❌ RULE 2 VIOLATIONS: Obstruction of Exit

**Dark Patterns**
- Hidden/hard-to-find cancellation buttons
- Cancellation path requiring more steps than signup
- Repeated opt-out confirmation screens
- Mandatory reason requirements for exit
- Harm: Traps users in unwanted subscriptions
- Example: 3 clicks to sign up; 7 screens to cancel

**Delayed Deletion**
- Account deletion taking 30 days (allowing time to convince)
- "Temporary" deletion that requires re-confirmation
- Data persisting after deletion request
- Harm: Enables time for re-engagement manipulation
- Example: 30-day account deletion period with re-activation offers

**Hidden Opt-Out**

- Harm: Exploits vulnerability; creates dependency
- Example: Nicotine targeting to adolescents (known vulnerability window)

**Identity Lock-In Through Behavioral Exploitation**
- Creating situation where changing belief requires public humiliation
- Using tribal belonging as hostage
- Making identity so public that reversal feels like shame
- Harm: Prevents rational reconsideration; traps in false beliefs
- Example: Platforms amplifying political identity so strongly that changing seems socially impossible

**Radicalization Engineering**
- Deliberately designing systems to push people toward extremism
- Identifying vulnerable individuals and funnel toward extreme content
- Predictive systems that intercept doubters with reinforcement
- Harm: Creates violent/extremist actors
- Example: YouTube rabbit holes systematically recommending more extreme content

**Emotional Hypnosis Through Fractionation**
- Engineered emotional cycles designed to reduce critical thinking
- Targeting real-time emotional state to maximize suggestibility
- Using neurochemistry (oxytocin from group synchrony) to bypass reasoning
- Harm: Disables conscious evaluation; induces trance-like compliance
- Example: Ritualized mass rallies with synchronized chanting, torches, music (90-110 BPM)

## OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES

### Auditing Your Design for Violations

**For Rule 1 (False Claims):**
- [ ] Can every product claim be verified?
- [ ] Are data practices accurately described?
