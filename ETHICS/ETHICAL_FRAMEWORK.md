## PART 1: CLASSIFICATION DIMENSIONS

### Information Asymmetry Framework

Influence effectiveness depends on information asymmetry: the gap between what the audience knows and what the source knows.

**Five Information Dimensions:**
1. **Content accuracy** - Correspondence between claims and factual reality
2. **Source identity** - Relationship between actual source and stated source
3. **Intent disclosure** - Clarity of source objectives and incentive structures
4. **Mechanism transparency** - Visibility of how influence strategies function
5. **Cognitive capacity** - Audience ability to evaluate information given processing demands

---

### Disclosure Dimension Classifications

**Full Disclosure (Tier 1):**
- All relevant information and mechanisms disclosed to audience
- Factual accuracy maintained; design intent transparent

**Partial Disclosure (Tier 2):**
- Some relevant information disclosed
- Mechanisms or targeting strategies not fully visible

**Hidden Mechanisms (Tier 3):**
- Relevant information withheld from audience
- Core targeting mechanisms and objectives concealed

---

### Targeting Dimension Classifications

**Population-Level:**
- Applied uniformly across populations
- Standard service delivery

**Group-Level:**
- Applied to demographic segments
- Psychological profile-based customization

**Individual-Level:**
- Applied based on individual psychological profiles
- Real-time behavioral calibration

---

### Operational Classification Dimensions

| Dimension | Characteristics |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 🔴 **Information Accuracy** | Credential verification, commercial disclosure, identity representation, testimonial authenticity, data practices |
| 🟠 **Exit Pathway Mechanics** | Cancellation complexity, upsell sequencing, deletion delays, opt-out steps, subscription visibility |
| 🟡 **Population Targeting** | Substance addiction targeting, financial vulnerability, psychological fragility, developmental vulnerability (minors), urgency-based conversion |

---

## PART 2: BEHAVIORAL MECHANISMS BY EFFECTIVENESS

### TIER 1: MAXIMUM EFFECTIVENESS (200%+)

#### 1. EMOTIONAL FRACTIONATION CYCLES
**Measured effectiveness:** 200%+ increased behavioral susceptibility
**Implementation timeframe:** 4 cycles in ~10 minutes
**Evolution:** Platforms (2010-2020) → AI calibration (2020-2026)
**Classification:** Individual-level emotional state targeting

**Operational Mechanism:**
- Algorithmic sequencing: anger → joy → anger → relief/solution
- Neurochemical response: craving for stability after emotional disruption
- Below-conscious-threshold operation (90-110 BPM heart rate entrainment)
- Real-time behavioral data enables individual-level optimization

**Documented Implementations:**
- TikTok FYP: discovered empirically through engagement optimization
- YouTube recommendations: sequential recommendation implementation
- Instagram/Facebook feeds: continuous optimization for this pattern
- Platforms generally: optimize engagement metrics without explicit mechanism understanding

**Technical Measurement:**
- Behavioral: engagement metrics and behavioral persistence
- Physiological: heart rate variability, skin conductance, blink rate patterns
- Neurochemical: cortisol, oxytocin, dopamine response profiles

**Ethical Boundary:** Approaches Rule 3 violation if targeting vulnerable populations

---

#### 2. IDENTITY LOCK-IN THROUGH PUBLIC COMMITMENT
**Measured effectiveness:** 65-90%+ behavior consistency after public act
**Evolution:** Bernays (product branding) → Goebbels (forced denunciation) → Platforms (algorithmic amplification)
**Classification:** Individual-level social targeting

**Operational Mechanism:**
- User takes public position (social media post, tweet, public donation)
- Algorithm amplifies to tribe/followers
- Tribe validates position
- Changing mind = public humiliation + loss of tribal status
- Brain forces belief alignment to justify public behavior (cognitive dissonance resolution)

**Why Effective:**
- Identity stronger than facts
- Public commitment → behavioral lock-in
- Social consequences (not just private belief change)
- Tribe membership acts as hostage

**Documented Implementations:**
- Twitter/X algorithmic amplification of takes
- Facebook group identity formation
- Reddit upvote systems rewarding tribal positions
- "Call-out culture" reinforcing identity lock

**Ethical Boundary:** Uses social pressure + algorithmic amplification, not deception or obstruction

---

#### 3. ALGORITHMIC ISOLATION & CUSTOM REALITY CONSTRUCTION
**Measured effectiveness:** 70-85% persistence of bubble-reinforced beliefs
**Evolution:** Goebbels (monopoly control) → Platforms (personalized bubbles) → AI (custom reality per user)
**Classification:** 🟠/🔴 (precondition for informed consent failure)

**Operational Mechanism:**
- Different users see different realities through algorithmic curation
- Counter-narratives actively suppressed from feed
- User perceives feed as objective reality (doesn't know they're in bubble)
- Can't coordinate resistance (can't see what others see)
- Self-reinforcing (algorithm learns what keeps user engaged)

**Why Effective:**
- Makes informed consent nearly impossible (can't know what you're missing)
- User doesn't recognize bubble (thinks they see reality)
- Removes external reality check
- Worse than monopoly: creates individualized false realities

**Ethical Boundary:** Within bounds if counter-narratives remain accessible (bubble, not monopoly)

---

### TIER 2: HIGH EFFECTIVENESS (50-90%)

#### 4. DEFAULT CHOICE ARCHITECTURE
**Measured effectiveness:** 50-90% depending on friction
**Example:** Organ donation: 40% opt-in vs. 90% opt-out
**Evolution:** Kahneman (identified) → Platforms (automated into design)
**Classification:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Operational Mechanism:**
- Path of least resistance = platform-desired outcome
- Most users accept default rather than actively decide
- Changing default requires decision energy; most don't expend it

**Documented Implementations:**
- Newsletter subscribed by default (4-5x higher signup than opt-in)
- Netflix "Continue Watching" defaults
- Spotify "Add to Queue" pre-selected
- Cookie preferences with "accept all" as default

**Ethical Boundary:** Transparent, legal, reversible—but exploits decision-making bias

---

#### 5. AUTHORITY SIGNALS (Credibility Transfer)
**Measured effectiveness:** 65%+ obedience increase with authority symbol
**Example:** Milgram: 65% administered shocks WITH authority, 20% without
**Evolution:** Bernays (fake experts) → Goebbels (destroyed real authorities) → Platforms (influencer authority) → AI (deepfakes)
**Classification:** 🟡/🔴 (deepfakes = Rule 1 violation)

**Operational Mechanism:**
- Lab coat = authority even if wearer isn't doctor (symbol matters more than competence)
- Credibility transfers: "Expert says X" → "X is true"
- Works even when audience knows it's persuasion technique

**Documented Implementations:**
- Influencer endorsements (authority = social proof, not expertise)
- Certification programs without actual competence verification
- Blue checkmark signals (status, not competence)
- Academic-sounding studies funded by interested parties

**Ethical Boundary:** Transparent authority (disclosed credentials) = OK. Fake credentials/deepfakes = Rule 1 violation

---

#### 6. SOCIAL PROOF (Manufactured Consensus)
**Measured effectiveness:** 35-75% depending on visibility and recency
**Example:** Cialdini: "75% of guests reuse towels" = 35% more compliance
**Evolution:** Bernays (multiple sources same message) → Cialdini (measured) → Platforms (algorithmic amplification)
**Classification:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Operational Mechanism:**
- Perceived consensus drives behavior more than actual consensus
- Shows 5-star reviews, hides 1-star reviews (representative bias)
- "Most people are doing X" notifications create bandwagon effect
- Bot armies can create illusion of popularity

**Ethical Boundary:** Real testimonials showing distribution = OK. Fake reviews/deceptive selection = Rule 1 violation

---

#### 7. SCARCITY & LOSS AVERSION
**Measured effectiveness:** 60%+ higher conversion
**Example:** "Only 2 left" beats "Great deal"
**Evolution:** Bernays (manufactured obsolescence) → Goebbels (existential scarcity) → Cialdini (measured) → Platforms (dynamic scarcity)
**Classification:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Operational Mechanism:**
- Loss aversion: "You might LOSE this" hits harder than "You could GAIN this"
- Real scarcity: Actually limited inventory
- Fake scarcity: "Only 3 left" refreshes infinitely
- Dynamic scarcity: "5 people viewing now" (real count but shown to many)

**Ethical Boundary:** Honest scarcity = OK. Fake scarcity = Rule 1 violation

---

### TIER 3: MODERATE EFFECTIVENESS (30-70%)

#### 8. RECIPROCITY OBLIGATION
**Measured effectiveness:** 2x+ higher compliance
**Example:** Unexpected gift → 2x raffle ticket purchases
**Evolution:** Bernays (free samples) → Cialdini (measured) → Platforms (free tier → obligated upgrade)
**Classification:** ✅ GREEN

**Ethical Boundary:** Transparent exchange = OK. Hidden quid pro quo = Rule 1 violation

---

#### 9. ANCHORING EFFECT
**Measured effectiveness:** 40-60% pull toward first number mentioned
**Note:** Works even when anchor is obviously random
**Evolution:** Kahneman (identified) → Pricing strategy optimization
**Classification:** ✅ GREEN

**Ethical Boundary:** Transparent anchor = OK. Fake original price = Rule 1 violation

---

#### 10. COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY
**Measured effectiveness:** 30-70% depending on commitment magnitude
**Evolution:** Bernays (small action locks identity) → Goebbels (forced public commitment) → Platforms (public social media commitment)
**Classification:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Operational Mechanism:**
- Once you take small commitment, pressure to behave consistently
- Written > verbal (more binding)
- Public commitment > private (shame factor)

**Ethical Boundary:** Voluntary commitment = OK. Coerced public commitment = Rule 3 violation

---

#### 11. UNITY & TRIBE BELONGING
**Measured effectiveness:** 30-60% loyalty effect
**Example:** Minimal Group Paradigm: random assignment creates instant loyalty
**Evolution:** Freud (group archetypes) → Bernays (segmented identities) → Goebbels (unified enemy) → Platforms (algorithmic tribalization)
**Classification:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Ethical Boundary:** Genuine community = OK. Algorithmic tribalization creating artificial enemies = 🟡/🔴

---

### TIER 4: MODERATE-LOW EFFECTIVENESS (15-50%)

#### 12. SEMANTIC FRAMING & NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE
**Measured effectiveness:** 20-40% behavior change
**Evolution:** Bernays (symbolism > logic) → Goebbels (narrative before facts) → Platforms (algorithmic narrative)
**Classification:** 🟡/✅ GREEN-YELLOW

**Ethical Boundary:** True facts, alternative framing = OK. Facts selected to misrepresent = Rule 1 violation

---

#### 13. MICRO-TARGETING & PERSONALIZATION
**Measured effectiveness:** 30-50% depending on accuracy
**Evolution:** Bernays (segment by archetype) → Platforms (psychological segmentation) → AI (vulnerability identification)
**Classification:** 🟡/🔴 YELLOW-RED

**Ethical Boundary:** Efficient personalization = OK. Targeting vulnerable populations = Rule 3 violation

---

#### 14. REPETITION & COMPULSION LOOPS
**Measured effectiveness:** Cumulative (3-5 exposures = illusory truth effect)
**Evolution:** Freud (compulsion repetition) → Bernays (yearly events) → Goebbels (70-80% broadcasts) → Platforms (infinite scroll) → AI (predictive optimization)
**Classification:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Operational Mechanism:**
- Repeated exposure = illusory truth effect (familiar = true)
- False statements feel true after 3-5 exposures
- Works even when person knows it's false

**Ethical Boundary:** Transparent repetition = OK. Deceptive repetition = Rule 1 violation

---

#### 15. AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC (Vivid = Frequent)
**Measured effectiveness:** 20-40% bias in frequency estimation
**Evolution:** Bernays (media multiplication) → Goebbels (frequency saturation) → Platforms (algorithmic amplification)
**Classification:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Ethical Boundary:** Proportional coverage = OK. Disproportionate amplification = 🟡/🔴

---

#### 16. LIKING & SIMILARITY (Peer Authority)
**Measured effectiveness:** 20-35% depending on perceived similarity
**Evolution:** Bernays (salespeople trained to compliment) → Cialdini (identity assignment) → Platforms (relatable influencer personas)
**Classification:** ✅ GREEN

**Ethical Boundary:** Authentic community = OK. Manufactured parasocial relationships = 🟡

---

#### 17. VISUAL SHAME + PRODUCT SOLUTION PAIRS
**Measured effectiveness:** 15-30% behavior change
**Evolution:** Bernays (bathroom contest with shame imagery) → Modern marketing (before/after transformations)
**Classification:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Ethical Boundary:** Addressing real needs = OK. Amplifying insecurity for artificial need = 🟡

---

### TIER 5: LOW EFFECTIVENESS (10-30%)

#### 18. SUNK COST FALLACY (Endowment Effect)
**Measured effectiveness:** 10-30% depending on cost magnitude
**Evolution:** Kahneman (identified) → Platforms (engineered entry costs)
**Classification:** ✅ GREEN

**Ethical Boundary:** Transparent costs = OK. Hidden switching costs = Rule 2 violation

---

#### 19. MENTAL ACCOUNTING (Bucket Psychology)
**Measured effectiveness:** 10-25% valuation changes
**Evolution:** Kahneman (identified) → Behavioral design
**Classification:** ✅ GREEN

**Ethical Boundary:** Using mental accounting = OK. Hiding true costs = Rule 1 violation

---
