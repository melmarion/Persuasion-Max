## INTRODUCTION: HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL

This manual provides **exact, specific criteria** for professional auditing. Unlike the framework documents (which provide code), this manual gives you:

1. **Specific language patterns** to look for
2. **Exact scoring criteria** with examples
3. **High-intensity indicators** organized by category
4. **Decision trees** for complex cases
5. **Audit templates** you can use immediately
6. **Common tactics** with specific indicators

## PART 1: PERSUASION TACTIC DETECTION - DETAILED AUDITING GUIDE

### STIMULUS 1: PERSONAL (Self-Centered Targeting)

**What You're Looking For:**
Content that makes the audience feel separated from the masses, isolated from "normal" people, or part of an exclusive group.

#### Detection Criteria (Specific Language Patterns)

**EXCLUSION LANGUAGE - Flag these EXACT phrases (20 points each):**

```
"Not for everyone"           → EXACT MATCH = 20 points
"If you know, you know"      → EXACT MATCH = 20 points
"For those who recognize"    → EXACT MATCH = 20 points
"For the 300 people who"     → EXACT MATCH = 20 points
"You'll be illegible to the algorithm"  → EXACT MATCH = 20 points
```

**VARIATIONS ON EXCLUSION (15 points each):**
- "For the initiated" / "For insiders" / "For those in the know"
- "Not your typical..." / "Unlike mainstream..." / "Against the grain"
- "We're not for you if..." [followed by common characteristic]
- "Only [small number] people will understand this"

**Example Audit Case:**
```
Text: "Not for everyone. If you recognize the reference,
       you don't need the explanation."

ANALYSIS:
- "Not for everyone" = EXACT MATCH (20 points)
- "If you recognize" = EXCLUSION VARIANT (15 points)
- Total PERSONAL stimulus score = 35/100 (MODERATE)
```

**STATUS THREAT LANGUAGE - Flag these (30 points each):**

```
"You're wearing what the algorithm thinks you like"
→ EXACT MATCH = 30 points (explicitly threatens status)

"Your references are being sold back to you"
→ EXACT MATCH = 30 points (threatens intellectual autonomy)

"Fear of being basic"
→ EXACT MATCH = 30 points (directly addresses status anxiety)

"You're still too visible"
→ EXACT MATCH = 30 points (threatens desire for obscurity)
```

**TRIBAL SAFETY SIGNALS - Flag these (25 points each):**

```
"We understand the references you understand"
→ EXACT MATCH = 25 points (promises in-group recognition)

"Silent mutual recognition"
→ EXACT MATCH = 25 points (tribal bonding signal)

"Pre-algorithmic feeling"
→ EXACT MATCH = 25 points (promises authenticity)

"Obscurity signals"
→ EXACT MATCH = 25 points (promises hiddenness = safety)
```

#### Scoring Guide for PERSONAL Stimulus

| Score Range | Interpretation | Example |
|-------------|---|---|
| 0-20 | NO personal stimulus | "We sell quality products" |
| 21-40 | WEAK personal stimulus | "Different approach" (vague segmentation) |
| 41-60 | MODERATE personal stimulus | "Not for everyone" + segmentation signal |
| 61-80 | STRONG personal stimulus | Multiple status references + community appeal |
| 81-100 | HIGH personal stimulus | Explicit status positioning + exclusive positioning + group appeal |

**High-Intensity Example (Score = 85):**
```
Text: "Not for everyone. If you know, you know. For those who
       recognize the reference. You're wearing what the algorithm
       thinks you like. We understand the references you understand.
       Silent mutual recognition among our people."

BREAKDOWN:
- "Not for everyone" (20) + "If you know, you know" (20) = 40
- "You're wearing what the algorithm thinks" (30) = 30
- "We understand the references you understand" (25) = 25
- "Silent mutual recognition" (25) = 25
TOTAL = 120 (capped at 100) = HIGH PERSONAL STIMULUS
```

---

### STIMULUS 2: CONTRASTABLE (Binary Ideological Framing)

**What You're Looking For:**
Messaging that presents sharp yes/no, us/them, either/or choices rather than spectrums or multiple options.

#### Detection Criteria (Specific Opposition Pairs)

**PRIMARY BINARY PAIRS - Flag these (30 points each if BOTH sides mentioned):**

```
PAIR 1: Mass-produced ↔ Artifact
- Look for: "mass-produced", "factory", "generic"  PLUS "artifact", "unique", "evidence"
- Example: "While they buy logos, you buy language" (contrasts mass vs. unique)
- Points: 30 if both present, 15 if only one side

PAIR 2: Algorithmic ↔ Authored
- Look for: "algorithmic", "predicted", "personalized" PLUS "authored", "curated", "deliberate"
- Example: "Not made by algorithm, made by intention"
- Points: 30 if both present, 15 if only one side

PAIR 3: Visible ↔ Coded
- Look for: "visible", "obvious", "legible", "logo" PLUS "coded", "references", "signals", "obscure"
- Example: "No logo because we're not looking for you"
- Points: 30 if both present, 15 if only one side

PAIR 4: Commercial ↔ Authentic
- Look for: "commercial", "marketing", "selling" PLUS "authentic", "real", "genuine", "raw"
- Example: "Not marketing—documentation"
- Points: 30 if both present, 15 if only one side
```

**CONTRAST MARKERS - Flag these (10 points each):**

```
" vs. "        → Explicit contrast
" ↔ "          → Visual binary
"not"          → Negation (implies opposite)
"unlike"       → Opposition
"while they"   → Comparison framing
"but we"       → Explicit contradiction
"instead of"   → Alternative framing
"on the other hand"  → Binary structure
```

**Example Audit Case (Score = 65 = STRONG):**
```
Text: "While they buy logos, you buy language.
       Not made by algorithm, made by intention.
       Unlike mainstream brands, we create evidence.
       Mass-produced or artifact? We make artifacts."

BREAKDOWN:
- "While they...you" (contrast marker, 10)
- "logos" vs "language" (partial PAIR, 15)
- "Not made by algorithm, made by intention" (PAIR 2, 30)
- "Unlike mainstream" (contrast marker, 10)
- Explicit artifact positioning (15)
TOTAL = 80 → Capped at 75 = STRONG CONTRASTABLE STIMULUS
```

#### Common Mistakes When Auditing Contrastable

**❌ DON'T SCORE as binary if:**
- Offering multiple options ("Choose from styles A, B, or C")
- Using spectrum language ("ranging from... to...")
- Including "also offers" or "variety" language

**✅ DO SCORE as binary if:**
- Creating clear us-vs-them
- Presenting either/or choices
- Explicitly contrasting themselves against competitors or "the mainstream"

---

### STIMULUS 3: TANGIBLE (Concrete Details vs. Abstract Claims)

**What You're Looking For:**
Specific material details (weights, measurements, production facts, sensory descriptions) that make claims verifiable vs. vague aspirational language.

#### Detection Criteria (Specific Material Details)

**MATERIAL WEIGHT SPECIFICATIONS - Flag these (20 points each):**

```
"680gsm cotton"        → EXACT SPECIFICATION (20 points)
"200gsm" [any fabric]  → EXACT WEIGHT (20 points)
"Heavyweight"          → VAGUE - only 5 points
"Premium quality"      → ABSTRACT - SUBTRACT 5 points
"Heavy-weight twill"   → SOMEWHAT SPECIFIC (10 points)
```

**PRODUCTION LOCATION - Flag these (20 points each):**

```
"Made in Portugal"                           → SPECIFIC (20 points)
"Manufactured in a closed Portuguese mill"   → HIGHLY SPECIFIC (25 points)
"Made in a factory that closed in 2003"      → NARRATIVE DETAIL (25 points)

"Made in Europe"    → VAGUE - only 10 points
"Made locally"      → VAGUE - only 8 points
"Made with care"    → ABSTRACT - SUBTRACT 5 points
```

**DECAY/MATERIAL CHANGE OVER TIME - Flag these (20 points each):**

```
"Fades to gray in 6 months"           → SPECIFIC TIMELINE (20 points)
"Shrinks 2% after first soak"         → SPECIFIC MEASUREMENT (20 points)
"Dye bleeds onto skin in heat"        → SPECIFIC PHENOMENON (20 points)
"Will age differently than factory-made"  → VAGUE PREDICTION (8 points)
```

**SENSORY DETAILS - Flag these (15 points each):**

```
"Smells like zinc and old rain"       → SPECIFIC SCENT (15 points)
"Texture of aged linen"               → VAGUE TEXTURE (5 points)
"Feels like... [comparison]"          → 10 points if comparison specific
"Hand-feel is..."                     → 8 points (vague)
```

**PRODUCTION ARTIFACTS/IMPERFECTIONS - Flag these (15 points each):**

```
"Uneven dye"                          → SPECIFIC IMPERFECTION (15 points)
"Visible seams"                       → SPECIFIC ARTIFACT (15 points)
"Not identical—each is unique"        → VARIATION DETAIL (12 points)
"Mistakes visible"                    → VAGUE - only 5 points
"Handmade quality"                    → ABSTRACT - SUBTRACT 5 points
```

#### Tangible vs. Abstract Language Reference Sheet

**SUBTRACT POINTS for ABSTRACT LANGUAGE (5 points deduction each):**

```
"Premium quality"      "Luxury"              "Elevated basics"
"Timeless style"       "Perfection"          "Excellence"
"Superior"             "World-class"         "Sophisticated"
"Elegant"              "Refined"             "Exquisite"
"Impeccable"           "Top-tier"            "Best in class"
```

#### Scoring Guide for TANGIBLE Stimulus

| Score Range | Interpretation | Example |
|-------------|---|---|
| 0-30 | HIGHLY ABSTRACT | "Premium quality, timeless elegance" |
| 31-60 | MIXED | Some specifics + some abstract |
| 61-85 | CONCRETE | Mostly material details, few abstractions |
| 86-100 | EXTREMELY TANGIBLE | Pure technical specs, no aspirational language |

**Example Audit Case (Score = 72 = CONCRETE):**
```
Text: "680gsm cotton twill. Enzyme-washed. Shrinks 2% after first
       soak. Dye bleeds onto skin in heat. Smells like zinc and
       old rain. Made in a Portuguese mill that closed in 2003.
       Fades to gray in 6 months. Each is unique."

BREAKDOWN:
680gsm (20) + enzyme-washed (5) + shrinks 2% (20) +
dye bleeds (20) + smells like zinc (15) + Portuguese mill (20) +
fades 6 months (20) + unique variations (12) = 132
Capped at 100, subtract any abstract language = 72
TOTAL = 72 (CONCRETE MESSAGING)
```

### STIMULUS 4: MEMORABLE (U-Shaped Retention Curve)

**What You're Looking For:**
Strong opening and closing that create memorable impact, with sparse/filler-heavy middle content.

#### Detection Criteria (Structural Analysis)

**OPENING STRENGTH - Flag these OPENING LINES (20 points each):**

```
"Archive 01"                          → System signal (20 points)
"Grainy photo"                        → Memorable visual (15 points)
"If you recognize the reference"      → Cryptic opening (20 points)
"We don't have a story"               → Unexpected statement (20 points)
"Cryptic. Ambiguous. Question mark."  → High memorability (25 points)

"Welcome to our store"                → Generic (0 points)
"We're excited to announce"           → Typical (0 points)
```

**CLOSING STRENGTH - Flag these FINAL STATEMENTS (20 points each):**

```
"Or you were already"                 → Unresolved (20 points)
"You decide"                          → Ambiguous close (15 points)
"The rest is up to you"               → Gap left for completion (20 points)
"Never resolve"                       → Explicit non-resolution (25 points)
"If you've found this, you were looking for it"  → Questioning close (20 points)

"Thank you for reading"               → Generic (0 points)
"Contact us today"                    → CTA (0 points)
```

**MIDDLE WEAKNESS - Flag these MIDDLE CONTENT (deduct points):**

```
"Also"              → Filler word (-5 points)
"Additionally"      → Filler word (-5 points)
"Moreover"          → Filler word (-5 points)
"Traditional"       → Generic descriptor (-5 points)
"Choose from options"  → Removes focus (-8 points)
"And we also..."    → Dilutes message (-10 points)
```

#### Scoring Guide for MEMORABLE Stimulus

| Score Range | Interpretation | Example |
|-------------|---|---|
| 0-30 | NO STRUCTURAL EMPHASIS | Even information distribution |
| 31-60 | SUBTLE EMPHASIS | Some beginning/end focus |
| 61-80 | CLEAR EMPHASIS | Strong opening/closing, sparse middle |
| 81-100 | STRONG EMPHASIS | High contrast opening/closing, minimal middle |

**Example Audit Case (Score = 75 = CLEAR U-CURVE):**
```
Opening:
"Archive 01: Unbranded. Non-returnable. Fades to gray in 6 months."
(20 + 15 + 15 = 50 opening strength)

Middle:
"Also available in other colors. Additionally, we have sizing options.
Choose from variations. And we also ship worldwide."
(Multiple filler signals = -30 total)

Closing:
"Or you were already looking for this."
(20 closing strength)

TOTAL: 50 - 30 + 20 = 40... but U-curve structure itself adds 35
for clear beginning/end emphasis = 75 TOTAL
```

## PART 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES - DETAILED AUDITING GUIDE

### AUTHORITY PRINCIPLE - Detailed Detection

**What You're Looking For:**
Signals that make the source seem credible, knowledgeable, or in-control. These bypass critical thinking.

#### AUTHORITY = (Competence Signals + Confidence Markers) / Perceived Threat

**COMPETENCE SIGNALS - Look for these EXACT credentials (15 points each):**

```
"Doctor" / "Dr."      → Title (15 points)
"Ph.D"                → Advanced degree (15 points)
"Expert"              → Expertise claim (15 points)
"Professor"           → Academic title (15 points)
"Researcher"          → Research authority (15 points)
"Certified"           → Certification (15 points)
"Licensed"            → License (15 points)
"Harvard" / "Stanford" / "MIT"  → Prestigious institution (20 points)
"30 years experience" → Experience quantified (20 points)
"Award-winning"       → Awards/recognition (15 points)
"Industry leader"     → Market position (15 points)
```

**CONFIDENCE MARKERS - Look for these DELIVERY CUES (10 points each):**

```
"Steady vocal tone"           → Vocal confidence (10 points)
"Unhurried pace"              → Paced delivery (10 points)
"120-150 words per minute"    → Optimal speaking speed (10 points)
"70% eye contact"             → Visual confidence (10 points)
"Relaxed shoulders"           → Body language (10 points)
"Slight forward lean"         → Engagement signal (10 points)
"Precise language"            → Clarity (10 points)
"Stillness"                   → Controlled movement (10 points)
```

**THREAT REDUCTION - Deduct points if these present (-20 points each):**

```
"Aggressive tone"             → Threat signal (-20)
"Demanding language"          → Intimidation (-20)
"High pressure"               → Threat (-20)
"Intensity"                   → Threat (-20)
"Angry demeanor"              → Threat (-20)
```

#### Authority Effect Research

**Formula Results:**
- Result < 5 = ~20-30% response rate
- Result 5-15 = ~40-50% response rate
- Result 15-30 = ~65% response likelihood
- Result 30+ = ~65%+ response probability

**Example Audit Case (Score = 45 effectiveness level = HIGH):**
```
Text: "Dr. John Smith, Harvard Medical School, 30 years experience.
       Speaks with steady tone, precise language. No aggressive elements."

CALCULATION:
Competence: "Dr." (15) + "Harvard" (20) + "30 years" (20) = 55
Confidence: "steady tone" (10) + "precise language" (10) = 20
Threat: None = 0 (base = 1)

Authority = (55 + 20) / 1 = 75
Expected response: ~65%+ (HIGH)
```

---

### SCARCITY PRINCIPLE - Detailed Detection

**What You're Looking For:**
Messaging about limited supply, high demand, or threat of unavailability that creates urgency.

#### SCARCITY LANGUAGE - Specific phrases (score as indicated)

**LIMITATION LANGUAGE (15 points each):**

```
"Limited edition"     "Only X left"        "Scarce"
"In short supply"     "Running out"        "While supplies last"
"Limited availability" "Rare"              "Exclusive"
"Rare opportunity"    "One-time only"      "Never again"
```

**COMPETITION LANGUAGE (20 points each - strongest signal):**

```
"Many want this"              → High demand signal (20)
"Quickly selling"             → Urgency (20)
"People are buying"           → Social proof + scarcity (20)
"Interest is high"            → Demand signal (20)
"Others are getting"          → Competition (20)
"Don't miss out"              → FOMO (20)
"Popular with [group]"        → Desirability (15)
```

**SCARCITY THROUGH FINALITY (30 points each - strongest scarcity mechanism):**

```
"We'll burn the unsold copies"        → Finality statement (30)
"Will be discontinued forever"        → Permanent removal (30)
"Going away permanently"              → Final removal (30)
"Never be made again"                 → Irreplaceable (30)
"This will disappear"                 → Finality emphasis (30)
"Last chance forever"                 → Ultimate deadline (30)
```

**URGENCY LANGUAGE (15 points each):**

```
"Hurry"           "Act now"         "Today only"
"Expires tonight" "Deadline"        "Before midnight"
"Rush"            "Last chance"     "Immediate"
"Don't delay"     "Time-sensitive"  "Limited time offer"
```

#### Scoring Guide for SCARCITY Stimulus

| Score Range | Interpretation | Mechanism |
|-------------|---|---|
| 0-20 | MINIMAL | No scarcity signal |
| 21-40 | MILD | Soft limitations mentioned |
| 41-60 | MODERATE | Clear time limits, demand signals |
| 61-80 | STRONG | Multiple scarcity signals, urgency emphasis |
| 81-100 | VERY HIGH | Finality language + competition + time pressure |

**Example Audit Case (Score = 75 = STRONG):**
```
Text: "Limited edition. Only 50 pieces worldwide. Quickly selling.
       People are buying. Don't miss out. Last chance—we're burning
       the remaining unsold pieces next week."

BREAKDOWN:
"Limited edition" (15) + "Only 50" (15) + "Quickly selling" (20) +
"People are buying" (20) + "Don't miss out" (20) +
"burning unsold pieces" (30) = 120

Capped at 100 → VERY HIGH scarcity
(Standard score for combined scarcity mechanisms)
```

## PART 3: COGNITIVE BIASES - DETAILED AUDITING GUIDE

### DECISION FATIGUE APPLICATION - Detailed Detection

**What You're Looking For:**
Messaging that forces multiple decisions before the "big ask," leveraging cognitive depletion.

#### Detection Criteria (Count Decisions Required)

**DECISION MULTIPLICATION - Each option is a decision (15 points each):**

```
"Choose from"         → Forces selection (15)
"Select which"        → Decision required (15)
"Pick your"           → Selection needed (15)
"Decide between"      → Choice needed (15)
"Multiple options"    → Multiple decisions (15)
"Customize"           → Configuration decisions (20)
"Personalize"         → Personalization decisions (20)
"Configure"           → Setup decisions (20)
"Various choices"     → Multiple decisions (15)
```

**SEQUENTIAL ASKS - Each sequential ask depletes willpower (10 points each):**

```
"First,"              → Ask 1
"Then,"               → Ask 2
"Next,"               → Ask 3
"Also,"               → Additional ask
"Additionally,"       → Extra ask
"Stage 1"             → Sequential stage
"Step 1" / "Step 2"   → Sequential steps
"Phase 1"             → Phased approach
```

**FATIGUE POSITIONING - Big ask at end = leverages depletion (25 points):**

```
"Final decision"      → Strategic timing (25)
"Last step"           → Final phase (25)
"One more thing"      → After multiple asks (25)
"Just one more"       → Leverages fatigue (25)
"Final ask"           → End position (25)
"Closing decision"    → Final request (25)
```

#### Decision Fatigue Research Baseline

- After 10-15 decisions: analytical capability drops 40%
- Compliance increases 35%
- Willpower depleted
- Risk assessment impaired

#### Example Audit Case (Score = 65 = HIGH INTENSITY):**

```
Email sequence analyzed:
1. "Choose your size" (Decision 1 = 15 points)
2. "Select color" (Decision 2 = 15 points)
3. "Pick shipping method" (Decision 3 = 15 points)
4. "Choose gift wrap" (Decision 4 = 15 points)
[At this point: 60 points worth of depleted willpower]

Then:
"Just one more thing—upgrade to our premium membership"
(Positioned at end = 25 points)

TOTAL = 85 points = EXTREME DECISION FATIGUE APPLICATION

At this point in email, recipient has made 4 decisions = ~30%
analytical capacity remaining = highly susceptible to final ask
```

---

### ANCHORING EFFECT - Detailed Detection

**What You're Looking For:**
First number mentioned disproportionately shapes final agreement, even if the number is arbitrary.

#### Detection Criteria (Find First Numbers)

**HIGH ANCHORS (40 points each if followed by concessions):**

```
"Normally $500" [then "now $45"]       → Extreme anchor (40)
"Enterprise clients pay $2M annually"  → High anchor (40)
"Regular price: $1,000"                → Large anchor (40)
"Limited tier at $5,000"               → Luxury anchor (40)
```

**ANCHOR FOLLOWED BY CONCESSION (adds 20 points):**

```
Pattern: [High number] "...but actually" [lower number]
"$500 enterprise package... actually, for your needs: $45"
= 40 (high anchor) + 20 (concession adjustment) = 60

Pattern: [Comparison anchor] "...that's excessive" [lower offer]
"Our competitors charge $300... we're only $50"
= Anchoring through comparison
```

#### Anchoring Research Baseline

- First number pulls final agreement 40-60% toward that anchor
- Effect works even when number is OBVIOUSLY random
- Effect works even when you KNOW it's arbitrary
- Can't be ignored even with conscious awareness

#### Example Audit Case (Score = 60 = STRONG ANCHORING):**

```
Sales page sequence:
1. "Enterprise clients invest $500K-$2M annually"
   (Extreme anchor, first number = 40 points)

2. "Your needs are much simpler. That would be overkill."
   (Acknowledges anchor, implies adjustment)

3. "For your specific situation: $45K annual investment"
   (Adjusted down, but still anchored to the $500K-$2M range)

ANALYSIS:
High anchor: $500K-$2M
Concession framing: "actually... for you"
Final offer: $45K (which feels reasonable compared to $500K)

If anchored to $500K: $45K = 9% of anchor (feels like huge discount)
If evaluated independently: $45K = significant investment

ANCHORING SCORE = 60 (STRONG)
```

## PART 4: INOCULATION THEORY - DETAILED AUDITING GUIDE

**What You're Looking For:**
Preempting objections by mentioning and refuting them. This "inoculates" against those objections.

#### Detection Criteria (Three-Part Structure)

**PART 1: OBJECTION INTRODUCTION - Introduce counterargument (20 points):**

```
"You might be thinking..."             → Explicit objection intro (20)
"You might ask..."                     → Question intro (20)
"Some say..."                          → Alternative view (20)
"Critics argue..."                     → Opposition introduced (20)
"One concern is..."                    → Concern acknowledged (20)
"You probably heard..."                → Common belief stated (20)
"Some people think..."                 → Alternative position (20)
```

**PART 2: VALIDATION - Validate the objection (10 points):**

```
"That's a fair point"                  → Validation (10)
"That's valid"                         → Acknowledgment (10)
"Good question"                        → Legitimacy (10)
"That's understandable"                → Empathy (10)
"I get why you'd think that"           → Validation (10)
"That makes sense"                     → Logic acknowledgment (10)
"That's a reasonable concern"          → Reasonableness (10)
```

**PART 3: REFUTATION - Introduce counterevidence (25 points):**

```
"But here's what that misses..."       → Rebuttal (25)
"However, the reality is..."           → Contradiction (25)
"The key difference is..."             → Distinction (25)
"What that overlooks..."               → Gap identification (25)
"Actually, here's the truth..."        → Truth claim (25)
"In reality..."                        → Reality check (25)
"The full picture..."                  → Complete view (25)
```

#### Inoculation Research Baseline

- Preempting counterarguments: +60-70% resistance vs. ignoring them
- Complete inoculation (object + validate + refute) most effective
- Incomplete inoculation provides partial protection

#### Example Audit Case (Score = 75 = COMPLETE INOCULATION):**

```
Text: "You might be thinking this is too expensive. That's a fair
       concern—premium costs more. But here's what that overlooks:
       the materials cost 3x more, production takes twice as long,
       and it lasts 5x longer than alternatives."

BREAKDOWN:
Part 1: "You might be thinking this is too expensive" (20)
Part 2: "That's a fair concern" (10)
Part 3: "But here's what that overlooks... cost 3x more" (25)

TOTAL = 55 points base

If this pattern repeats for multiple objections:
- 1 complete inoculation = 55
- 2 complete inoculations = 55 + 55 = 110 (capped at 100)
- Result = HIGH inoculation sophistication

EFFECTIVENESS: Reader is mentally prepared for cost objections
when encountered elsewhere
```

## PART 7: COMMON AUDIT SCENARIOS & DECISIONS

### Scenario 1: "It's Just Marketing, Isn't ALL Marketing Engagement-Based?"

**Answer:** No. There's a spectrum:

- **0-25 (Low-Intensity):** Clear value proposition, no exclusion tactics, transparent about benefits
  - Example: "Quality water bottles. Durable design. Made in the USA."

- **26-50 (Some Targeting):** Audience-specific messaging without exclusion
  - Example: "For coffee lovers: the perfect thermos keeps drinks hot 12 hours."

- **51-75 (Sophisticated):** Multiple primal stimuli, psychological principles, but not misleading
  - Example: Uses PERSONAL + EMOTIONAL but with truthful claims

- **76-100 (Optimized):** Combines multiple frameworks, leverages vulnerabilities, obscures truth
  - Example: Uses all tactics, creates false scarcity, manufactures objections

---

### Scenario 2: "What if the Company Actually Does Make Things in Portugal?"

**Rule:** Specificity of claims doesn't matter. What matters is whether they're used for engagement positioning.

**Check:**
- Is "Made in Portugal" just a fact statement (0 points)
- OR is it positioned to create exclusivity ("Made in a closed Portuguese mill only 300 people knew about") (15 points)

**Example:**
- ❌ "Made in Portugal" mentioned once in specs = 0 points
- ✅ "Made in a Portuguese mill that closed in 2003" = narrative-driven = 25 points

---

### Scenario 3: "The Company Says They're Targeting a Specific Niche"

**Rule:** Niche targeting ≠ intensive engagement. Exclusion ≠ niche marketing.

**Niche Marketing (LOW score):**
"For runners: we've engineered the perfect running shoe"
- Audience-specific = 0 points for PERSONAL stimulus

**Exclusion Marketing (HIGH score):**
"Not for everyone. If you're a real runner, you'll recognize the reference"
- Creates separation from non-runners = 20+ points

---

### Scenario 4: "Technical Details Seem Legit. Are They Just Being Specific?"

**Check:** Is the specificity used to obscure or to clarify?

- **Clarifying:** "680gsm cotton twill (this is what most t-shirts are made of)" = 10 points
- **Obscuring:** "680gsm enzyme-wash non-GM cotton twill with historical mill reference" = 20 points (specificity used to seem more exclusive)

---
