## OVERVIEW: 3-DOCUMENT DETECTION SYSTEM

All content from Compilation.txt has been converted into **3 professional detection frameworks** (2,533 lines of code and documentation):

### Document 1: TACTICAL_INFLUENCE_DETECTION_FRAMEWORK (1,072 lines)
**Covers:** Neuromarketing tactics using 6 Primal Brain Stimuli
- PERSONAL (Self-centered targeting)
- CONTRASTABLE (Binary ideological framing)
- TANGIBLE (Material specificity vs. abstraction)
- MEMORABLE (U-shaped retention curve)
- VISUAL (Anti-aesthetic vs. polished)
- EMOTIONAL (Fear-to-relief arc)

**Plus:** Composite audit system + Red team framework + Portfolio-wide auditing

---

### Document 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL_PRINCIPLES_DETECTION_FRAMEWORK (791 lines)
**Covers:** Cialdini's Principles + Cognitive Biases

**Cialdini's 6+1 Principles:**
1. AUTHORITY (Credibility, titles, symbols)
2. SOCIAL PROOF (Consensus, peer behavior)
3. RECIPROCITY (Give-first obligation)
4. COMMITMENT/CONSISTENCY (Foot-in-door escalation)
5. SCARCITY (Limitation, competition, destruction)
6. LIKING (Similarity, attraction, flattery)
7. UNITY (In-group framing)

**Cognitive Biases:**

### Document 3: ADVANCED_INFLUENCE_FRAMEWORKS (670 lines)
**Covers:** Sophisticated influence strategy architectures

**Advanced Techniques:**
1. Cognitive Load Management (complexity/time-pressure/distraction)
2. Decision Fatigue Application (depletion of willpower)
3. Inoculation Theory (preempting objections)
4. Environmental & Temporal Priming (location/time/sequence)
5. Authority Infiltration & Capture (compromising influencers)
6. Fee Architecture (pricing for sophistication targeting)
7. Manufactured Reality (Herman & Chomsky's 5 Media Filters)

## DETECTION CODE ORGANIZATION

### Tactical Framework (11_TACTICAL...)

**Detectors:**
```python
PersonalStimulausDetector()       # Exclusion/status targeting
ContrastableDetector()             # Binary us-vs-them framing
TangibleDetector()                 # Concrete vs. abstract language
MemorableDetector()                # U-curve information structure
VisualDetector()                   # Anti-aesthetic vs. polished
EmotionalDetector()                # Fear-to-relief arc
ComprehensiveInfluence strategyAudit()  # Combines all 6 stimuli
RedTeamAuditChecklist()            # Professional auditing
PortfolioAudit()                   # Multi-content analysis
```

**Output:** `composite_score` (0-100) indicating influence strategy intensity

---

### Psychological Framework (12_PSYCHOLOGICAL...)

**Detectors:**
```python
AuthorityDetector()                # Credentials, titles, symbols
SocialProofDetector()              # Consensus, peer pressure
ReciprocityDetector()              # Give-first obligation
CommitmentDetector()               # Escalation, foot-in-door
ScarcityDetector()                 # Limitation, competition, destruction
DefaultChoiceDetector()            # Opt-in vs. opt-out architecture
AnchoringDetector()                # First number effect
ComprehensivePsychologicalAudit()  # All principles combined
```

**Output:** Individual principle scores + composite psychological influence strategy score

---

### Advanced Framework (13_ADVANCED...)

**Detectors:**
```python
CognitiveLoadDetector()            # System 1/2 hijacking
DecisionFatigueDetector()          # Willpower depletion leverageation
InoculationTheoryDetector()        # Objection preemption
EnvironmentalPrimingDetector()     # Location/time/sequence effects
AuthorityInfiltrationDetector()    # Influencer compromise tactics
FeeArchitectureDetector()          # Sophistication-based pricing
ManufacturedRealityDetector()      # Media filter architecture
CompleteAdvancedInfluence strategyAudit() # All advanced frameworks
```

**Output:** Sophistication scores + red flags + structural bias detection

---

## SCORING SCALES REFERENCE

### Stimulus Scores (Tactical Framework)
- **0-25:** Minimal/no usage
- **26-50:** Moderate usage
- **51-75:** Strong usage
- **76-100:** Extreme/optimized usage

### Psychological Principle Scores
- **0-25:** No principle detected
- **26-50:** Weak/subtle principle usage
- **51-75:** Strong principle deployment
- **76-100:** Extreme/intensive usage

### Advanced Framework Scores
- **0-25:** Minimal sophistication
- **26-50:** Moderate sophistication
- **51-75:** High sophistication
- **76-100:** Expert-level influence strategy architecture

### Composite Scores
- **0-25:** LOW influence strategy intensity (low-intensity messaging)
- **26-50:** MODERATE influence strategy (some targeting)
- **51-75:** HIGH influence strategy (sophisticated tactics)
- **76-100:** EXTREME influence strategy (optimized)

## REAL-WORLD AUDIT WORKFLOWS

### Workflow 1: Single Content Piece Audit
```python
from detection_frameworks import ComprehensiveInfluence strategyAudit

# Audit a single piece of content
auditor = ComprehensiveInfluence strategyAudit()

# Combines all 6 stimuli
tactical_audit = auditor.audit_content(
    text="Product copy or ad text...",
    image_description="Visual description..."
)

print(f"Influence strategy score: {tactical_audit['composite_score']:.0f}/100")
print(f"Tactics detected: {tactical_audit['vulnerability_profile']}")
```

### Workflow 2: Multi-Framework Audit
```python
from detection_frameworks import (
    ComprehensiveInfluence strategyAudit,
    ComprehensivePsychologicalAudit,
    CompleteAdvancedInfluence strategyAudit
)

# Analyze content through 3 frameworks
content = "Your marketing copy here..."

tactical = ComprehensiveInfluence strategyAudit().audit_content(content)
psychological = ComprehensivePsychologicalAudit().audit_psychological_principles(content)
advanced = CompleteAdvancedInfluence strategyAudit().audit_all_advanced_frameworks(content)

# Combined score
overall_influence strategy = (
    tactical['composite_score'] +
    psychological['composite_influence strategy_score'] +
    advanced['total_influence strategy_sophistication']
) / 3

print(f"Overall influence strategy: {overall_influence strategy:.0f}/100")
```

### Workflow 3: Portfolio-Wide Audit
```python
from detection_frameworks import PortfolioAudit

# Audit entire brand portfolio
portfolio = {
    "product_page": "...",
    "email_1": "...",
    "instagram_caption": "...",
    "about_page": "...",
    "pricing_page": "..."
}

portfolio_audit = PortfolioAudit().audit_entire_portfolio(portfolio)

print(f"Portfolio average: {portfolio_audit['portfolio_average_influence strategy_score']:.0f}/100")
print(f"Highest risk: {portfolio_audit['highest_risk_touchpoints']}")
```

## RED TEAM AUDIT CHECKLIST

Use this for professional internal auditing:

### Phase 1: Tactical Analysis
- [ ] Run ComprehensiveInfluence strategyAudit on all customer-facing content
- [ ] Check for each stimulus (PERSONAL, CONTRASTABLE, TANGIBLE, MEMORABLE, VISUAL, EMOTIONAL)
- [ ] Document composite scores by content type
- [ ] Identify which stimuli are most frequently deployed

### Phase 2: Psychological Analysis
- [ ] Check for Cialdini principles (Authority, Social Proof, Reciprocity, Commitment, Scarcity)
- [ ] Identify any problematic principle combinations
- [ ] Note which psychological principles are strongest

### Phase 3: Advanced Analysis
- [ ] Scan for cognitive load tactics
- [ ] Check decision fatigue leverageation patterns
- [ ] Verify inoculation theory usage (if preempting objections)
- [ ] Identify environmental priming hooks

### Phase 4: Reporting
- [ ] Generate portfolio audit report
- [ ] Identify highest-risk content pieces
- [ ] Create recommendations for each
- [ ] Develop remediation priority list
