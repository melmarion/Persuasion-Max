## QUICK START (Do This Now)

**Step 1: Open 03_DEVELOPER_QUICKSTART.md**

**Step 2: Follow Week 1: Build Fractionation Algorithm**
- Create project structure (30 min)
- Build classifier (2 hours)
- Build sequence detector (2 hours)
- Build API endpoint (1 hour)
- Write tests (1 hour)
- Total: ~6 hours

**Step 3: Deploy Locally**
- Start API server
- Test with sample data
- Verify it works

**Result after 6 hours:** You have a working fractionation detector
