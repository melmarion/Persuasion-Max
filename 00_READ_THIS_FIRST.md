## RESEARCH POSITIONING

**Interdisciplinary approach:**
Integration of psychology, neuroscience, technology, and economic frameworks enables measurement of phenomena that single-discipline approaches cannot address.

**Domain gaps:**
- Tech researchers lack psychological measurement frameworks
- Neuroscientists lack scalable data collection from algorithmic systems
- Economists lack neurochemical modeling

This research addresses these gaps through integrated methodologies.

---

## COMMERCIALIZATION POTENTIAL

### Possible Application Markets
- Real-time detection systems
- Organizational assessment tools
- Research platforms
- Clinical diagnostic tools
- Educational applications

Specific revenue potential depends on market adoption, pricing models, and competitive landscape.

---

## RESEARCH DIRECTION CHOICES

### Traditional Single-Discipline Approach
- Publish within one disciplinary framework
- Focus on specific psychological or neuroscience mechanisms
- Limited interdisciplinary citation potential

### Integrated Cross-Disciplinary Approach
- Publish across multiple disciplinary venues
- Develop integrated measurement frameworks
- Address research questions requiring multiple domains
- Broader potential citation reach and impact
